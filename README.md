## Library for BMP180 and BMP280 (Barometric Pressure Sensors)

## Description

This library provides essential functionality and data structures to streamline communication, control, and interaction with the BMP180 and BMP280 barometric pressure and temperature sensors. The library is designed for integration into embedded software on a variety of architectures.

## BMP180 Sensor

The BMP180 is a Bosch Sensortec precision sensor that excels in measuring both barometric pressure and temperature. It provides high accuracy, with 0.01 hPa precision for pressure and 0.1째C for temperature, within a range of 300 hPa to 1100 hPa (+9000m to -500m relative to sea level). This sensor's I2C interface enables effortless integration with embedded systems.

## BMP280 Sensor

Similar to the BMP180, the BMP280 is a high-precision sensor developed by Bosch Sensortec for barometric pressure and temperature measurements. With a pressure measurement range of 300 hPa to 1100 hPa and a temperature range of -40째C to +85째C, the BMP280 provides exceptional accuracy with 0.01 hPa precision for pressure and 0.1째C for temperature. The I2C interface easily integrates with embedded systems, and its power-saving features and low noise level of 0.06 hPa RMS in the lowest power mode make it a great option for many applications.
